given an array of integers [a1,a2,a3,....,an]
find a pair of integers from the array where xor of cnti and cntj is max.
where cnti represents the no of non prime factors for the ith element in the array. If there are multiple pairs having the same value then select the pair whose
min(ap, aq) < min(ax,ay) then select (ap,aq)

if min(ap, aq) = min(ax,ay) then select the pair having the higher value that is if max(ap,aq) > max(ax,ay) select (ap,aq) otherwise select (ax,ay).

print the pair of integers such that the first number is less than or equal to the second

//1<=T<=100
//2<=N<=50
//2<=Ai<=1e12
